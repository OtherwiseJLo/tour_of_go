# Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments. 

In this example, `add` takes two parameters of type `int`.

Notice that the type comes _after_ the variable name.

## Functions continued

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can
omit the type from all but the last.

In this example, we shortened 
```go
x int, y int
```

to 

```
x, y int
```
